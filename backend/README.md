# Back-end
Tools: Java, Spring Boot, Postman, Docker, Render, Vercel 

## To-be done:

- [ ] Recheck crew-related entity and their logic

## Challenges:
- It's been a long time since I code with Java so some slight hitch at first
- Getting started from scratch, as it can be difficult thinking of a starting point (many use cases and many different entities to manage)
- Jumping off from above point, making sure things are consistent with API doc to ensure smooth integration with frontend
- I had to brush up lightly on my relational database basics :>
- Keeping the Entity-Controller-Service system consistent. I tend to think of each entity separately and ended up (at first) with different ways to handle inputs and outputs, which caused problems with testing
- Unit tests are tiring but are indeed very necessary. Also help improve consistency (and (in)dependency between entities)
